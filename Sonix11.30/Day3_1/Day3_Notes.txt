HTML will not perform 


	-> Validations

	-> Business Logic

	-> Event-Based Programming 

To implement those, we need the help of Javascript. 

To start with javascript, use 

<script>
</script> 

alert() -> Used to display message in dialog box. 
document.writeln() -> Used to display message on document. 

javascript code, to be added in functions. 

function function_name() {
...
...
...
}

How to call the methods...

You can call these methods by using events. 

onload() -> This event will be fired automatically once the page loaded.

onclick() -> This event will be fired automatically once you click on 
	button/div etc...

How to declare variable in javascript ???
___________________________________________

var is the keyword that which allows you to declare variable. 

var x = 12 // then it becomes int

var str = "Sravani" // then it becomes string. 

What is the difference between

var x =  12;

x++ (vs) ++x 

postincrement (vs) PreIncrement 

In PostIncrement, first it initializes the value, then it increments

In PreIncrement, first it increments the value, then it assigns. 

eval() : Used to evaluate the given mathematica expression final value.

Control Structures : Used to define the flow of the program. 

There are 2 types of control structures known as 

	(i) Branching : 

	if...else : Executes the statement(s) based on the condition.

	 if (condition) {
	     statement(s);
	 } else {
	     statement(s);
	 }

(i) Write a program to Check max. of 3 numbers 

(ii) Write a Program to generate current bill as read no.of units and calculate according to slabs

	first 90 units 1rs

	Next 91 to 150 units 1.5 rs
	
	151 to 200 units 2 rs

	201 to 240 units 2.5 rs

	240+  3 rs

Then if no.of units are 160 

(90 * 1) + (60 * 1.5) + (10 * 2)

switch...case : used to define menu-driven programs. 

switch(expression) {
    case expression1 : 
	statement(s);
        break;
    case expression2 : 
	statement(s);
	break;
    case expression3 : 
	statement(s);
        break;
    default : 
	statement(s);
        break;
}

You can get value of the checkbox by using checked property.

It returns either true or false only. 

onchange() :This event mostly we apply for radio buttons and checkboxes. As we can identify change in status w.r.t.



	(ii) Looping
