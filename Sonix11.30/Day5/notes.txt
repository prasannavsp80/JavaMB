onblur() : This even acts as lostfocus. 

As once you move from cursor of any control, you need
to execute some lines of code, then we need the help
of onblur(). 

Control Structures : used to define the flow of the program. 

There are 2 types of control structures known as

(i) Branching

	if...else : Executes the statement(s) based on the condition.

		if (condition) {
			statement(s);
		} else {
		   statement(s);
		}

switch...case : Implements the menu-driven programs. Here, we need to use break keyword to come out of the control structure. 

12

"12"

Write a Program to accept a grade, and 

if grade is "I" or "A" or 'a' print 'Grade A'
if grade is "II" or "B" or 'b' print 'Grade B'
if grade is "III" or "C" or 'c' print 'Grade C'
else print 'Invalid Grade'

How to get form values

formName.controlName.value;

(ii) Looping 

forloop : Executes the statements repeatedly until the condition remains true, if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop.

for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement) {
   statement(s);
}

There are pre-defined functions as 
___________________________________

  (i) String Functions : 

	indexOf() -> Display's the first occurrence of given char. 

 (ii) Number Functions : Numbers functions are accessable by using Math library. 

	abs() : Returns the absolute value. 

(iii) Date Functions 

	You can create date operations as 

	var obj = new Date();

Then it creates a date w.r.t. Today's date.
